# Focus Timer ‚è∞
  
<p align="justify"> How do you stay organized? How do you handle your studies or work? It's evident that all the distractions, interruptions, and the lack of focus and motivation contribute to your confusion and disorganization. For many people, time is like an enemy. So, the main aim of this project is to make time our valuable ally, helping us achieve what we want and the way we want it, and empowering us to continuously improve our work or study processes. </p>
